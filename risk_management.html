                    due to a lack of manual testing support. This vertical had no automated tests, all tests over the
                    software were performed manually through a web browser. To solve this issue, ETM and EUS components
                    were modified to support manual testing as well. Furthermore, even with manual testing included
                    into the platform, for this vertical it was not possible to improve any metric by using ElasTest.
                    Therefore, as a second measure it was decided to implement an additional integration not originally
                    foreseen in the DoA. TestLink, a tool for test management, was integrated in the platform. In
                    addition, an initial experimentation has been performed to ensure the validation approach works,
                    with the new features added, and all verticals were able to complete the experiment.
