                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%; font-weight: bold;">Table 1. Competences provided by the ElasTest partners for executing the project.</p>

                <p>Every partner contributes to ElasTest consortium with the following expertise:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>URJC:</strong> the involved researchers constitute a leading group in Europe in the area of FOSS applied to complex distributed systems involving communications. The fact that this group coordinates ElasTest reinforces the neutrality of the ElasTest community and contributes to its impact. </li>
                  <li><strong>FRAUNHOFER:</strong> the involved researchers are well know worldwide for its industrial activities and involvement in complex telecommunication infrastructures. </li>
                  <li><strong>TUB:</strong> the involved researchers constitute a leading group in Europe in the area of applied research for cloud infrastructures, software defined networks, and cloud technologies. </li>
                  <li><strong>CNR:</strong> the involved researchers are worldwide leaders in the theoretical foundations of Software Engineering for Testing. The group lead is one of the researchers with more citations worldwide.</li>
                  <li><strong>IMDEA:</strong> the involved researchers are worldwide references in the theoretical foundations of Runtime Verification and Systems Security, having also experience in knowledge transfer to industry. </li>
                  <li><strong>ATOS:</strong> the involved researchers bring all the deep market knowledge of ATOS to the consortium. ATOS is one of the major European software development and cloud provider companies. </li>
                  <li><strong>ZHAW:</strong> the involved researchers are European leaders in the area of cloud service orchestration being a reference group in applied research for cloud computing technologies. </li>
                  <li><strong>NAEVATEC:</strong> this SME brings to the consortium a deep market knowledge in relation to complex and distributed software systems for multimedia communications. </li>
                  <li><strong>IBM:</strong> the involved researchers bring to the consortium the deep industrial and market knowledge of IBM in the area of machine learning and cognitive computing systems. </li>
                  <li><strong>REL:</strong> this SME brings to the consortium deep market knowledge in relation to the management of large amounts of log data and its processing and analytics for extracting relevant information from it.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As it can be observed in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the consortium brings together the appropriate partner profiles for covering the whole value chain of complex systems testing going from the theoretical foundations of software engineering up to the vertical industrial application domains. Moreover, the consortium integrates all sensibilities and partner profiles with the appropriate balance of academia, research, large industries and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_es">SMEs</a>.
